# SD_python_exam

The purpose of this script and associated files is to count observed substrings of a specified length of a sequence of nucleotides, count possible substrings of a specified length in a sequence of nucelotides, and calculate the linguistic complexity of a sequence of nucleotides.  

There are 3 files included in the repo:    
      
1. sequence_analysis.py - is the python script. This should be run from the command line on a terminal and requires a file input. If running in the URI Jupyter server, you MUST use the "python3" command instead of just "python" to run the script, otherwise it will round the output numbers down improperly.    

2. test_sequence_analysis.py - is the test script, which tests the functions in the sequence_analysis script for errors. You can run it directly from the command line, but it assumes the sequence_analysis.py file accessible in the same directory because it will import the functions from that script.  

3. Example_sequences.txt - is a file of example sequences to be used with the sequence_analysis script. Please download the file locally and provide the appropriate filepath to the file on your machine or server when running the sequence_analysis script.
