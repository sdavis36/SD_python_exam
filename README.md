# SD_python_exam

The purpose of this script and associated files is to count observed substrings of a specified length of a sequence of nucleotides, count possible substrings of a specified length, and calculate the linguistic complexity of a sequence of nucleotides.  

There are 3 files included in the repo:    
      
1. sequence_analysis.py - is the python script. This should be run from the command line on a terminal and requires a file input.     

2. test_sequence_analysis.py - is the test script, which tests the functions in the sequence_analysis script for errors.    

3. Example_sequences.txt - is a file of example sequences to be used with the sequence_analysis script. Please download the file locally and provide the appropriate filepath to the file on your machine or server when running the sequence_analysis script.   
      
      
******NOTE - all the functions work great on their own. For the life of me I cannot get the script to return any values for linguistic complexity other than zero when reading from a file. It will correctly print the sequence and the length, meaning it's reading those in appropriately, but won't calculate correctly. I have tried many versions of the loop/code, but each has been unsuccessful. I'm sorry!******
